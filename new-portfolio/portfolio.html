        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>My portfolio showcases my work in interactive media and creative coding, particularly my projects in Max. I want to create a gallery where I can share my experience and progress with family, friends, future artists, and potential collaborators. While I am not currently looking for a job, I want my portfolio to be a record of my work that I can later use for future job opportunities. My strengths lie in blending technology with art to create engaging music videos and 3d model experiences. My work often explores interactivity and perception and I want my portfolio to reflect these themes. My creative vision requires visitors to experience my work in person rather than static images, which not only showcases my work as intended but results in a much more exciting experience for the viewers.</p>

            <h3>Still Life in Charcoal</h3>
            <p>Medium: Charcoal on paper</p>
            <p>Dimensions: 9 x 12 in</p>
            <p>This piece explores light, shadow, and form through a classic still life setup featuring wine bottles and a glass. The use of charcoal emphasizes texture and tonal contrast, allowing the viewer to feel the quiet atmosphere of the scene. The process was intuitive, focusing on capturing the depth of the composition and the reflective surfaces with expressive shading.</p>

            <p>Medium: Clay and metallic finish</p>
            <p>Dimensions: 4 x 4 in</p>
            <p>This sculptural medallion reflects my fascination with gaming culture and achievement. Inspired by the idea of completion and dedication, the piece transforms a personal passion into a physical object that symbolizes effort, patience, and reward. The textured surface and circular design suggest both the tactile nature of play and the timeless appeal of collecting and mastery.</p>

            <h3>Daydream Room</h3>
            <p>Medium: Watercolor and ink on paper</p>
            <p>Dimensions: 9 x 12 in</p>
            <p>In this surreal interior scene, I merge imagination and memory to create a dreamlike environment where the sky becomes the walls and the sun shines indoors. The checkerboard ceiling and colorful floorboards evoke a sense of playfulness and escape. Through this piece, I explore how personal spaces can reflect both our inner worlds and our desire for comfort and creativity.</p>
