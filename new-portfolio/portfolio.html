        <div class="portfolio-intro">
          <p>My portfolio brings together my work in interactive media, creative coding, and traditional art to explore how technology and imagination can shape perception. Whether I'm programming projects in <a href="art-103-final.html" class="highlight-link">Max</a> or creating pieces like my <a href="charcoal-drawing.html" class="highlight-link">charcoal still life</a>, <a href="game-completionist.html" class="highlight-link">Game Completionist</a>, or <a href="daydream-room.html" class="highlight-link">Daydream Room</a>, I aim to blur the line between the digital and physical worlds.</p>
