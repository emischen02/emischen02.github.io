        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>My portfolio brings together my work in interactive media, creative coding, and traditional art to explore how technology and imagination can shape perception. Whether I’m programming projects in Max or creating pieces like my charcoal still life, Game Completionist, or Daydream Room, I aim to blur the line between the digital and physical worlds. My still life studies the quiet beauty of everyday forms, Game Completionist transforms my passion for gaming into a tactile symbol of creativity, and Daydream Room captures the surreal and playful nature of imagination. Across both digital and handmade works, I focus on interactivity, emotion, and discovery—inviting viewers to experience my art not just as images, but as evolving spaces of reflection and connection.</p>

            <h3>Still Life in Charcoal</h3>
            <p>Medium: Charcoal on paper</p>
            <p>Dimensions: 9 x 12 in</p>
            <p>This piece explores light, shadow, and form through a classic still life setup featuring wine bottles and a glass. The use of charcoal emphasizes texture and tonal contrast, allowing the viewer to feel the quiet atmosphere of the scene. The process was intuitive, focusing on capturing the depth of the composition and the reflective surfaces with expressive shading.</p>

            <p>Medium: Clay and metallic finish</p>
            <p>Dimensions: 4 x 4 in</p>
            <p>This sculptural medallion reflects my fascination with gaming culture and achievement. Inspired by the idea of completion and dedication, the piece transforms a personal passion into a physical object that symbolizes effort, patience, and reward. The textured surface and circular design suggest both the tactile nature of play and the timeless appeal of collecting and mastery.</p>

            <h3>Daydream Room</h3>
            <p>Medium: Watercolor and ink on paper</p>
            <p>Dimensions: 9 x 12 in</p>
            <p>In this surreal interior scene, I merge imagination and memory to create a dreamlike environment where the sky becomes the walls and the sun shines indoors. The checkerboard ceiling and colorful floorboards evoke a sense of playfulness and escape. Through this piece, I explore how personal spaces can reflect both our inner worlds and our desire for comfort and creativity.</p>
