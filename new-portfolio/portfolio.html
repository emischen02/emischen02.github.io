        <h2>About this Portfolio</h2>
        <p>My portfolio brings together my work in interactive media, creative coding, and traditional art to explore how technology and imagination can shape perception. Whether I’m programming projects in Max or creating pieces like my charcoal still life, Game Completionist, or Daydream Room, I aim to blur the line between the digital and physical worlds. My still life studies the quiet beauty of everyday forms, Game Completionist transforms my passion for gaming into a tactile symbol of creativity, and Daydream Room captures the surreal and playful nature of imagination. Across both digital and handmade works, I focus on interactivity, emotion, and discovery—inviting viewers to experience my art not just as images, but as evolving spaces of reflection and connection.</p>

            <h3>Still Life in Charcoal</h3>
            <p>Medium: Charcoal on paper</p>
            <p>Dimensions: 9 x 12 in</p>
            <p>This piece explores light, shadow, and form through a classic still life setup featuring wine bottles and a glass. The use of charcoal emphasizes texture and tonal contrast, allowing the viewer to feel the quiet atmosphere of the scene. The process was intuitive, focusing on capturing the depth of the composition and the reflective surfaces with expressive shading.</p>

            <p>Dimensions: 4 x 4 in</p>
            <p>This sculptural medallion reflects my fascination with gaming culture and achievement. Inspired by the idea of completion and dedication, the piece transforms a personal passion into a physical object that symbolizes effort, patience, and reward. The textured surface and circular design suggest both the tactile nature of play and the timeless appeal of collecting and mastery.</p>

            <p>Medium: Watercolor and ink on paper</p>
            <p>Dimensions: 9 x 12 in</p>
            <p>In this surreal interior scene, I merge imagination and memory to create a dreamlike environment where the sky becomes the walls and the sun shines indoors. The checkerboard ceiling and colorful floorboards evoke a sense of playfulness and escape. Through this piece, I explore how personal spaces can reflect both our inner worlds and our desire for comfort and creativity.</p>

            <h3>Art 103 Final – Piano & Violin Digital Performance</h3>
            <p>Medium: Max/MSP/Jitter, digital 3D models</p>
            <p>Dimensions: Variable (digital composition)</p>
            <p>This multimedia piece combines custom 3D character animation with real-time audio, performed using Max/MSP/Jitter. By synchronizing virtual musicians with original music, the work explores the relationship between software-based creation and performative interactivity. The vibrant blue background and expressive digital figures highlight the intersection of code, music, and visual storytelling.</p>

            <h3>Black and White Photograms</h3>
            <p>Medium: Darkroom photogram on photographic paper</p>
            <p>Dimensions: Each image approx. 8 x 10 in</p>
            <p>These photograms were created in the darkroom by arranging objects directly on photographic paper and exposing them to light. The result is a unique composition of silhouettes and textures, exploring the interaction of light, transparency, and material. The layering of fabric and geometric motifs evokes both abstraction and personal narrative—inviting the viewer to interpret everyday forms in a new light. Each piece is original, not reproducible through digital means, and reflects the playful experimentation central to my practice.</p>

            <p>Dimensions: Variable (rendered image)</p>
            <p>This rendered still life combines form, material, and lighting study in a 3D graphics environment. Marble, ceramic, and glass textures are simulated digitally, with a glowing interior light and a geometric background. The piece invites viewers to contemplate the relationship between traditional artistic motifs and digital rendering.</p>

            <p>This interactive narrative invites players into the emotional turbulence of gaming and daily routines.
