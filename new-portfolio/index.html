        <main>
          <p>I am a junior at San Jose State University. I like to play video games and watch anime. My favorite video games are Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Fire Emblem. I like playing tennis just because I want to get some exercise. I want to become an artist who explores interactive digital media and creates something by drawing and taking photographs. My work is full of Max Patches that I did, including creating a music video, complete with images and sounds. I want to see my family, friends, and other people’s facial expressions when they experience my work and hear what it makes them feel.</p>

          <p>Two portfolio designs that inspire me are Andrew Blanton and American Artist. Andrew Blanton’s portfolio stands out because his homepage functions as a demo of his work, immediately immersing visitors in an interactive experience. I like how he presents his projects in a way that feels engaging rather than just a static gallery. Since my work involves Max and audiovisual media, I want to incorporate a similar approach by making my homepage feature videos or interactive elements. Also, he was my teacher last year for doing Art as System class. American Artist’s portfolio inspires me because of its clean, structured layout with a responsive menu. The simplicity of the layout makes the work the focus, while the design ensures easy navigation. I want my portfolio to reflect this clarity while still integrating dynamic elements like videos or hover effects. By combining these approaches, I plan to create a visually clean but interactive portfolio that effectively showcases my Max projects and digital experiments.
