          <h3>About Me:</h3>
          <p>I am a Senior at San Jose State University. I like to play video games and watch anime. My favorite video games are Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Fire Emblem. I like playing tennis just because I want to get some exercise. I want to become an artist who explores interactive digital media and creates something by drawing and taking photographs. My work is full of all of artworks that I did over the past few years during my community college year at College of San Mateo and here in San Jose State University. I want to see my family, friends, and other people’s facial expressions when they experience my work and hear what it makes them feel.</p>

          <h3>Artist's Statement:</h3>
          <p>My work explores the connections between emotion, environment, and imagination through a range of media including drawing, digital art, mixed media, and photography. I see art as a language that expresses what words often cannot—transforming everyday moments and personal experiences into visual stories that invite reflection and curiosity. What makes my work unique is my willingness to experiment with color, texture, and light to balance realism and abstraction, structure and spontaneity. Guided by intuition, I allow each piece to evolve naturally, embracing accidents and discoveries along the way. Through my art, I aim to evoke emotion, inspire thought, and remind viewers of the quiet beauty that exists in ordinary moments.</p>
